RLMTownyFactions

Description:
	RLMTownyFactions is a plugin for Bukkit, which simply makes Towny and Factions work together.
	In this implementation, Towny takes priority over Factions with regard to land-claiming. In
	other words, Factions will be unable to claim land already claimed by Towny, but the reverse
	will be allowed (possibly with Faction-unclaiming).
